TabStates is a small Google Chrome extension which allows users to to save/load groups of tabs through the use of the TabState manager located in the top right of the browser toolbar after installation.

## Installation

Install the extension by visiting this (non-existent) Chrome Web Store link: **[]()**

Or... provide local installation instructions

## How to Use

Screenshots of buttons and also mention of certain limitations (36 character limit for TabState names)

## Features:

- Save the group of tabs opened in the current window under a given "TabState name" 
- Load a saved TabState in the current window
- Load a saved TabState in a new window
- Open tabs individually that are contained within a saved TabState
- Change the name of a saved TabState
- Remove a previously saved TabState

## Planned Features:

- Ability to individually remove tabs that are contained within a saved TabState
- Ability to add the group of tabs opened in the current window to a pre-existing TabState
- Add export/import functionality to use the extension across different systems (may also add ability to do this without import/export if possible)
